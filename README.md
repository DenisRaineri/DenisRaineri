I am Denis, son of Almir Raineri, first of his name, owner of the Knowledge of Science and technology. 
I am searching ways to get power enough to claim the throne of my father. 
I am obsessed with idea of improving myself and I want a platform to grow and to find my ring to rule them all. 
I promise to be a fair technology King.
Denis has arrived. Enemies of the heir... beware!
